1. Installing NGINX -- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04
	1. ```
	$ sudo apt update
	```
	2. ```
	$ sudo apt install nginx
	```
	3. Allowing firewall access:
		1. ```
		$ sudo ufw allow 'NGINX HTTP'
		```
		2. ```
		$ sudo ufw status
		```
	4. Delete default (if running apache)
		1. ```$ cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled ```
		2. ```$ sudo rm default```
		3. We do this because if you have apache running, they both attempt to bind to port 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS) which is a big no no.
	5. start nginx with ```
	sudo service nginx start
	```
	6. Check NGINX is running with ```
	$ systemctl status nginx
	```
